 ## 📘 Overview 
  
 **YapYard** is an agentic feedback simulator that allows content creators to preview audience responses before posting online. It generates realistic comments from custom personas — critics, fans, experts, trolls, and more — to help creators desensitize themselves to fear, doubt, and online pressure.

 ## 🧠 Vision 
  
 YapYard empowers creators to break creative paralysis by giving them a mirror — not just to their content, but to their own inner critic. The more you post in YapYard, the less you fear posting anywhere else. 
  
 > Face the yard. Own the yap. Post anyway.
